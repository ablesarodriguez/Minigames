# Minigames-c-

## Description
This course introduced us to fundamental programming concepts, problem-solving strategies, and algorithm design. We worked with C++ to develop structured programs that reinforced logic and computation skills.

## Practical Work
- **Practice 1: Arithmetic Quiz Game**
  
  We developed a simple arithmetic quiz game where users solve math problems of varying difficulty levels. The program randomly generates addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems, awards points for correct answers, and ends when an incorrect answer is given.

- **Practice 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock**
  
  This practice involved creating a text-based game inspired by the Big Bang Theory version of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program follows predefined game rules and allows a user to play against a computer opponent.

- **Practice 3-4: MasterMind Game**
  
  We implemented a version of the classic MasterMind game where a player attempts to guess a hidden numeric code. After each attempt, the program provides feedback on correct numbers and their positions. The game runs in a loop until the user finds the correct code or reaches the maximum number of attempts.

- **Practice 5: Blackjack Game**
  
  We developed a simplified version of the card game Blackjack. The program manages a deck of cards, implements game rules, allows the user to play against the computer, and determines the winner based on the final scores.
